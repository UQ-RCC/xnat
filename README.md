Documentation for UQ Research Computing Centre (RCC) platforms, built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build).

# Sites and preview links

| Site | Folder | Production | Site preview |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| XNAT | `sites/xnat` | https://docs.xnat.rcc.uq.edu.au | https://uq-rcc-xnat.pages.dev |
| Pitschi | `sites/pitschi` | Not yet published | https://uq-rcc-pitschi.pages.dev |
| HPC | `sites/hpc` | Not yet published | https://uq-rcc-hpc.pages.dev |

> [!NOTE]
> Site previews always show the latest version of `main`. Production only changes when someone runs **Promote to production**.

# Editing a page using GitHub

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not have write access to this repository, GitHub automatically asks you to fork it first, and your change gets submitted as a pull request.

1. Go to the page on its [site preview](#sites-and-preview-links) and select **Edit page** at the bottom. GitHub opens the page's source file in its editor.
2. Make your changes. Use the **Preview** tab to check the formatting.
3. Select **Commit changes**, add a short message, and choose **Commit directly to the `main` branch**. The site preview updates in 1 to 2 minutes. The live site only changes when someone runs **Promote to production**.

To have a change reviewed before it reaches `main`, see [Site development with branches and pull requests](#site-development-with-branches-and-pull-requests).

Every page starts with a frontmatter block like this:

```md
---
title: Page title
---

The page content starts here.
```

Keep this block when you edit a page. A page without a `title` stops the whole site from building.

# Site development with branches and pull requests

To review a change before it reaches `main`, choose **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request** when you commit, then open the pull request.

- The pull request builds a branch preview at `https://<branch>.uq-rcc-<site>.pages.dev`, where `<branch>` is the branch name in lower case.
- A panel at the top of the pull request description shows the build's progress, then links to the branch preview and to a preview of that exact commit.
- Every further push to the branch updates the branch preview and the panel.
- Merging the pull request brings the change into `main` and updates the site preview. Production still only changes when someone runs **Promote to production**.

To get a branch preview without a pull request, run the **Preview** workflow for it from the **Actions** tab.

# Running the sites locally

Install once from the repository root, then run Astro from the site's folder:

```
npm install
cd sites/<site>
npx astro dev          # start the site at http://localhost:4321
npx astro build        # build the site to dist/
npx astro check        # type-check the site
npx astro preview      # preview the production build
node ../../.github/scripts/check-links.mjs dist   # check internal links and redirects
```

The dev server keeps running in the background after the command returns. Stop it with `npx astro dev stop` from the same folder. The `npm run` scripts in the root `package.json` run the XNAT site.
