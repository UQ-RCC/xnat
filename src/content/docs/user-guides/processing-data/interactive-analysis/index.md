You can access a Jupyter environment directly from XNAT. This allows you to run analysis on your data using familiar tools like Jupyter notebooks. RCC support can set up access to the Jupyter environment.

## Request access to the Jupyter environment

<Steps>

1. Open a ticket with RCC support. Fill in your XNAT project name/s that should be accessible from the Jupyter environment below and click to send a pre-filled email.

   <EmailJupyterRequestForm />

2. The support ticket will inform you when your access is set up. Jupyter access setup typically takes around ~24 hours from ticket submission.
